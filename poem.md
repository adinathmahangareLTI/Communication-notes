- Jack and Jill went up the hill
- To fetch a pail of water;
- Jack fell down and broke his crown
- And Jill came tumbling after.

- Where there is a will, There is a way
- You got to walk all the way
- Try and try, With you head high
- You will succeed faster
 
- Jack and Jill, With a strong will
- Went again up the hill
- Both were firm, Not to fall
- Brought down the pail of water.
